          The geometry and motility of the stomach play a critical role in the digestion of ingested liquid meals. Sleeve gastrectomy, 
          a common bariatric surgery, significantly alters the stomach’s structure and motility, which can impact gastric emptying and digestion. 
          This study investigates the changes in stomach geometry and gastric motility resulting from laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) and 
          their impact on digestion and gastric emptying using multiphase flow simulations.</p>

          <p>The pre-surgery stomach model was developed using MRI data. 
          Based on this, we constructed two post-surgery models using Blender (v4.1). 
          30% of the volume has been removed in the larger sleeve stomach, 
          and more than 60% of volume has been removed in the smaller one.</p>

          Four post-surgery scenarios were explored, including cases with a complete loss of peristalsis in the sleeve 
          tube, uncoordinated contractions in the sleeve, differences in fundus volume, and variations in the regions where antral contraction waves were preserved.

          <p>Simulations were conducted using an immersed-boundary flow solver, modeling a liquid meal to analyze 
          changes in gastric content mixing and emptying rates. 
          Our research has unveiled intriguing findings, demonstrating that varying degrees of 
          gastric volume reduction and impaired motility distinctly influence the stomach's transport, mixing, and emptying processes, 
          which are closely tied to the weight loss outcomes of bariatric surgery. A manuscript detailing these insights is currently 
          in preparation—stay tuned for more exciting results!</p>

              <p>Turbulent flows are essential in various engineering applications, and accurately predicting these flows is key to optimizing 
              the design and performance of various engineering systems. This research focuses on simulating turbulent channel flow using a combination of Large-eddy Simulation (LES) 
              and wall models within the context of Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM). This approach enables efficient and accurate simulation of turbulence with reduced 
              computational resources compared to traditional methods like Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS).</p>

              <p>This study implemented the Smagorinsky sub-grid scale model and the Musker wall model into a customized DNS code package of Lian-ping Wang's group. The LES method captures 
              large-scale turbulent structures and models the smaller, unresolved scales, while the wall model provides accurate near-wall flow behavior, significantly reducing the required grid resolution.</p>

              <figcaption>Numerical Setup</figcaption>  
              </div>

              The LES method effectively captured the streamwise velocity profiles, showing excellent agreement with DNS and published data. 
              Notably, the LES method accurately resolved the flow in both the viscous sublayer and the logarithmic layer.

              </div>

              The turbulent Reynolds stress profiles demonstrated that the LES approach could replicate essential flow characteristics.

              </div>

              The root-mean-square velocity profiles for different flow components (streamwise, transverse, and spanwise) were found to be 
              consistent with DNS data, further validating the LES method’s ability to capture turbulence intensity.

              </div>

              The near-wall velocity gradient, modeled using the Musker wall function, aligned well with theoretical expectations, 
              demonstrating that the wall model can predict near-wall behavior without the need for a high-resolution grid in that region.

              </div>

              A detailed comparison of turbulent viscosity showed that the LES approach approximated the turbulent-to-molecular viscosity ratio, confirming that the method was capable of accurately modeling turbulence even with a coarser grid.
              These results demonstrate that the combination of LES and wall models in LBM provides a robust framework for simulating turbulent channel flows efficiently and accurately. 
              This approach has significant potential for future applications in more complex turbulent flow simulations, such as urban canopy flows or higher Reynolds number cases.

          <h2></a> Introduction: </a></h2>

          In pancreatic disease diagnosis, pressure drop across the duct is a critical parameter, often associated with patient-reported pain levels. Establishing a predictive model that links pressure drop to clinical outcomes would aid in identifying patients requiring treatment. Current methods involve invasive procedures, where catheters are inserted into the pancreatic duct to measure pressure. This approach, while effective, is associated with high costs, patient discomfort, and the potential for complications. Hence, the development of a non-invasive diagnostic method is of paramount importance.

          The advent of advanced imaging techniques and computational methods presents an opportunity to address this challenge. The question arises: Can we predict which patients exhibit abnormal pancreatic duct behavior based solely on non-invasive imaging techniques, such as MRI? While preliminary studies suggest a degree of correlation, these methods are limited in accuracy and applicability to a small number of cases. A more accurate approach would involve utilizing CFD to simulate the flow within a reconstructed 3D model of the duct, enabling a precise prediction of pressure drop.
          
        </p>

        <p>
          <h2></a> Methods: </a></h2>
          <h3></a> Computational Fluid Dynamics Approach: </a></h3>

          In this study, we leverage CFD to simulate the flow of pancreatic juice, which behaves similarly to water, through the pancreatic duct. MRI data provided by collaborators at Johns Hopkins Medical Institute (JHMI) was used to generate high-resolution 3D reconstructions of the pancreatic duct. After processing the imaging data, we applied a meshing technique to discretize the duct geometry and imposed appropriate boundary conditions, such as mass flow rates at the inlet and outlet of the duct.

          The CFD simulations were carried out using a commercial CFD solver, with the goal of determining the pressure drop along the duct. The boundary conditions were set based on physiological mass flow rates, and the duct wall was assumed to be rigid. Results from the simulations were validated by comparing them with experimental pressure data obtained from 19 real-patient cases.
        
        </p>

        <p>
          <h3></a> Theoretical Model for Pressure Drop Prediction: </a></h3>

          To complement the computational approach, we developed a simplified theoretical model based on the Navier-Stokes equations for ducts with varying cross-sections. The key assumption in this model is that under constant mass flow conditions, the pressure drop depends solely on the geometric characteristics of the duct. These characteristics include duct length, cross-sectional area, curvature, and surface convexity.

          To simplify the analysis, we linearized the governing equations by neglecting nonlinear terms associated with high flow velocities. This allowed us to derive an integral expression for the pressure drop, where all the necessary duct parameters could be extracted directly from the 3D MRI model. The integral was evaluated numerically using an algorithm that we developed to extract the relevant geometric parameters from the 3D model.
          
        </p>

        <p>
          <h2></a> Results: </a></h2>

          The results of our CFD simulations demonstrated a strong correlation between the pressure drop and the geometric features of the pancreatic duct. By comparing CFD results with experimental measurements, we found that our simulations accurately captured the pressure drop behavior across a range of patient cases.

          Furthermore, the theoretical model was able to predict pressure drops within a 0%-20% error range when compared to the full CFD simulations. This level of accuracy suggests that the theoretical model, despite its simplicity, is a viable alternative for quick, non-invasive pressure drop predictions, especially in clinical settings where computational resources may be limited.

        <!-- <h3></a> Background </a></h3>
          Chronic pancreatitis with debilitating 
          abdominal pain can be caused by pancreatic 
          ductal hypertension. 
          
          The origin and biomechanical mechanism of the pancreatic ductal hypertension, 
          however, have not been well understood, 
          and this limits the success rate of 
          endotherapy and surgery to relieve hypertension. 
          
        </p>

        <p>
          <h3></a> Research Progress </a></h3>
        In order to investigate the correlation between pancreatic ductal 
          pressure and abdominal pain, we performed 
          patient-specific image-based computational 
          fluid dynamic analysis of pancreatic duct flows. 


          A 3D model of the pancreatic duct is 
          reconstructed from a magnetic 
          resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) imaging data, 
          and the computational fluid dynamics simulation is 
          performed to determine the flow pattern and measure 
          the pressure drop across the duct.

          and the patient pain score is analyzed.
